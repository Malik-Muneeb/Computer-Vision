1) Add missing code in the file detect_corners.py.
2) Run the get_results.bat batch file from cmd as
	get_results.bat YOUR_ROLL_NUMBER

This will create a .zip file with your roll number. Copy that .zip file in the appropriate folder on \\printsrv.


If you are interested, you may open the .bat file in Notepad to see what commands are being executed to generate results. DO NOT EDIT THE BATCH FILE.
